Curiously, you can't name the mongo DB container any name you like, it *has* to be "mongo".

This is reported (but not explained) here:

        https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1abcypf/mongoexpress_connecting_to_mongo27017_rather_than/

Another two issues were resolved after reading this:

        https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express-docker/issues/67

Specifically, I had to supply ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL in lieu of ME_CONFIG_MONGO_DB_SERVER and also set ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH to false.
